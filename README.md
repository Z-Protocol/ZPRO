# $ZPRO - ZPROTOCOL is a Sustainable Ecosystem|

ZPRO makes lending platforms more secure by eliminating the gas wars and shifting the minerâ€™s profit to the users.

WHAT IS Z-PROTOCOL?

We integrate $ZProtocol with existing lending platforms by letting the users interact with the lending platforms via a dedicated smart contract interface. And $ZProtocol liquidators get a priority in the liquidation process by providing a cushion to the user account when it is getting close to the liquidation price.


Z-Protocol Products

$ZProtocol is built atop a generic lending platform. The protocol API to end-user is identical to the lending platform API, and the only difference is that the users are interacting with different addresses. Liquidators provide the cushion with a top-up operation, and a scoring engine updates the user rating whenever he performs an operation. The user rewards are kept in a Jar that is distributed according to the user rating.
